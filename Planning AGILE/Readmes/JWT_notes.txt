# JWT (Jason Web Token)

- Authrization Techniques : 
	1. Session token (Reference Token)
	2. Jason Web Token (Value Token)

- Disadvantage of using session token:
	- Assumes one web app
	- If there are multiple web app for servicing different
	  requests, session token technique fails.
- JWT uses Load Balancer.
- JWT has Redis Cache.
	Note : If redis is down all session are down
- JWT returns data to the client rather than maintaining session id table.

# JWT Structure

- 3 colors
- 2 periods (.)

1. Payload 
	- Middle Layer
	- Data that we want to send
2. Header
	- Top layer
	- Contains data on how the token is signed
	- Has algorithm to verify signature
3. Signature
	- Authenticate layer
	- Calculates the string present in JW Token.

- If we change the value of token it will fail as signature is associated with original value only.
- Header has the algorithm which is generated by secret code present in signature layer.
- Client on every request sends JWT with HTTP header which is called Authentication bearer.
